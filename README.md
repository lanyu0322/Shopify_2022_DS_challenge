Here is a little bit background about me.I am an Urban Data Scientist and PhD candidate at the University of Delaware in Energy and Environmental Policy.
My work uses observational methods and data from the “Urban Observatory” (http://MUONetwork.org) to analyze images of city skylines through the application of computer vision and machine learning techniques to study energy consumption and lighting technology in cities, as well as inform operations and energy distribution policies.
